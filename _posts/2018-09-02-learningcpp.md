Today I'm continuing my journey reviewing C++ with more attention to details and with modern C++ syntaxing. School is great for covering the basics at an accelerated pace but if I want to tackle large projects with proper design I better learn it right.

Last week I covered chapters 1 through 7 from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.learncpp.com">learncpp.com</a>. I am extremely satisfied with the content this website covers. The author is very knowledgeable and he also keeps his website up to date with modern C++ syntax and techniques. Unlike books, this is a great way to learn C++ with new standards. Plus, it has a comment section where others may have questions or design approaches from their own.

I find this resource invaluable and recommend it to anyone who wants to learn C++. However, for people who have never coded before, I suggest the website and additional research (a bit of googling on tough topics) because he covers a lot of concepts that may overwhelm new learners. But for someone who has a bit of programming experience it's perfect and I'm learning things that I missed.
