In this post I will be outlining what I plan to do in the next couple of months.

Currently, I am doing a review of C++, this is my first programming language and by far a versatile language. It is able to do both low level and high level programming and is a strongly typed compared to other languages. It is also a greate gateway into learning other languages quickly. I'm using this week to go in depth in C++ as I feel that the language was rushed over too quickly in college. Even though college did go over many languages, I feel that the pacing was just too fast. So I will be going more in depth on this language this week.

After that, I plan on working on some mini-project using c++ to actually put what I learned into practice. I researched some project ideas from forums and videos that I could do some things in OpenGL or SDL which relates to game development. A lot lower level than using Unity the game engine which I have been using a lot before. But Unity was using C# which is a higher level language and the engine hides a lot of things under the hood like functionality and architecture that I am missing out on. So this might be something I can work on after reviewing C++.

At the same time after finishing reviewing C++, I plan on doing at least one or two hackerrank or leetcode problem a day, focusing on data structures and algorithms. This is mainly for interview prep and perhaps something I can implement in my projects if I find an interest to a particular data structure or algorithm.

The long term plan is that I hope to have a couple of C++ projects on my resume and a bit of fun. My resume currently seems to be a jack of all trades, I have a little of everything but not strong in any particular area. I am looking to focus my interests and then eventually my resume will reflect what I am interested in doing.

Some other things I plan on getting done is setting up a vpn on my raspberry pi using docker. Having a vpn will give me a bit more privacy. I also want to setup nextcloud on docker on the raspberry pi as well. I did setup nextcloud on my raspberry pi before, but that was without docker and I like the flexibility of docker so that's on my radar as well. Also setting up an nginx docker container so I can test several websites at a time on my raspberry pi. No particular website in mind so far, this blog is handled by Github so I don't plan on moving this site to the raspberry pi since Github's servers are much stronger than my tiny raspberry pi.

To wrap things up, I plan to update this blog a couple times a week. Make it a habit, I think it's a good idea to share my findings but probably with less writing. I'd like to keep it short and simple unlike this one. If you made it this far thanks for reading and stay tune for more updates!
