Hooray! The website now has a new look, I didn't want to deviate too far from the standard jekyll minima look so the nav bar is still very much the same but every page now has new colors, fonts, and a jumbotron on every page. I styled the jumbotron to look like a terminal, it sort of works like one too! It types out the path to the location of the website.

Designing this website took a lot of work, but I think I learned a lot about Jekyll today. The liquid templating language is so useful and easy to learn. It makes site wise usage very useful and easy. I used liquid mainly for the terminal directory path typing and doing a for loop to print out the posts. The liquid documentation I refered to is <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/">here</a>.

I found out about adding an icon to the tab section of my website. I didn't think about adding one until I saw so many error messages about a favicon.ico error when I served up my Jekyll website, haha. I got an open-sourced icon of a contact icon at <a href="https://icons8.com/icon/23867/open-source">icons8.com</a>.

Other resources that helped me build this site is following TaniaRascia's tutorial at <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/">www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll</a> which I based my website heavily on. I made major changes to the colors, text formatting, and to the jumbotron.

The jumbotron terminal is built using tameemsafi's typewriterJS code. I imported his CDN JS to be used on every page to create the typing effect. It's a great eye catcher! His website can be found <a href="https://safi.me.uk/typewriterjs/">here</a>.

Notice that there is now a contacts page, I put in my Twitter, LinkedIn, and email with the addition of some neat icons! I got the icons from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/getting-started?using=web-fonts-with-css">fontawesome.com</a>. Amazing how much free icons they offer for free. They are doing the community a great service.

Additionally, each page now have a "Go to top" link at the footer, it's a nice little feature to make life easier for the readers. It's so they won't have to scroll all the way to the top -- they made it to the bottom after all. Thanks readers!

Now there are still more left to be updated for this website, I still need to add in my projects with their own pages and update the home page to grab the latest project. Also there's a bit of an issue with the time format of posts as some times don't work, but it's a minor issue. Other than that it is mostly finished.

I believe that summarizes this website update post, stay tuned for when I add in my projects pages.
