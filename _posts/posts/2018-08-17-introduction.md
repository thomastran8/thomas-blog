Welcome to my new website, my old website has been removed for a more modular designed website -- which is this one! This website uses 'Jekyll' the static web site generator which is hosted on Github Pages for the cost of being free! Thanks Github! Currently, it uses the minima theme, but I plan on redesigning it a bit for more flair. Although, I do enjoy the minima look so I probably would try to stay close the original design. Now, I did find other themes online but I'd like to tailor my own theme, it would have more of a personal touch that way ;)
