Good news! My blogging website has finally reach v1.0. That means this is a stable version with all the basic features for my blogging website.

So what are these basic features? Let's start with the design. From the last time I've updated the website many of the font sizes were too bold and there were two font types. But now I made it so that there are no bold fonts and reduced the font type to one which is Open Sans only. I feel that open sans is a great legible font and is easy on the eyes.

Next, scroll to the bottom of the page. That's right, a comment section! Now in order to keep my posts relevant and active is to engage the audience. I am using Disqus which is great because they offer a free version with no ads for personal websites like this one. Thanks Disqus! Here's a link to <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> if interested.

I also made the terminal jumbotron a bit thinner. It got in the way of the content, which I find more important. I also quickened up the typing speed because no one wants to wait for the title to load for too long. The title's directory for posts got removed as well since it didn't look nice.

Each post now has its own image, by default it will be a newspaper, but in the front matter I can specify which image it can show. A added touch I made is that the images zoom in a bit when hovered over.

Comments are included with the post listings to show readers which post is popular. Right now it's not much and defaults to zero.

Information I changed behind the scene includes organizing the css. Mainly the scss files since the css includes scss. I added a reset scss file as that gets rid of any annoying side effects. Then I walked though all the scss files, cleaned up unecessary bits, and added new formatting bits. This took the longest to make my website look right.

Then I continued with smart uses of includes. In Jekyll, modularity is its strongest selling point. Jekyll parses the entire directory to find includes and front matter as building blocks for the website. The includes are actually part of a templating language called <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a> that handles a lot of the site-wide management.

Other things I added is <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/">Google Analytics</a> and made my website searchable by Google. I'm using this to gauge how my website is doing. I'm not looking for fame, just looking to share my interests in programming and technology thefore I am keeping this website 100% advertisement free. I would like to people to find the things I am doing useful.

In the mist of writing this post, I just remembered that I forgot to put in syntax highlighting for code. I guess I'll save that for version 1.1. This website will always have room for improvement, until then, there will be no final version. Cheers!
