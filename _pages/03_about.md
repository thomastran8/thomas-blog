## Introduction

Hi! I'm Thomas.

I love working with computers! I am an avid Linux user and free open source software enthusiast (FOSS). I program Linux applications and games in my free time.

I am looking for an oppurtunity to kick-start my career as a software engineer and to grow with an exciting company.


## Work Experience

- IT Admin, Skydio

I currently work at Skydio as an IT Admin. I joined in 2018 after I graducated UC Davis. Skydio is a startup company that manufactures drones that specializes in artificial intelligence. I manage the automation of all linux workstations and server machine provisioning at our company.

- Technical Assistant, CompTechS, DeAnza Community College

Before Skydio, I worked as a Technical Assistant at Comptech/OTI at DeAnza Community College. Comptech/OTI is a college internship program that prepares students for the IT field.

## Education

- Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, University of California, Davis

At my time at Davis, I joined the Game Development & Arts Club. I participated in every quarterly Game Jam and learned to collaborate with programmers and artists.

- Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)

## Hobbies

- Linux app development

I'm a really big fan of Linux and all things free and open source (FOSS). I'm taking some time to learn Qt Creator to create my own Linux apps. I want to make my apps all free and open source as an appreciation to contribute back to the community. Qt Creator uses C++ as a programming language which is actually my first language I learned in school. I feel right at home using this language.

- Game Development

I do indie game development. At the moment I have an interest in 3D game development. Some engines I worked with so far is the Unity Game Engine and the Godot Game Engine. I post regular game development project updates on my Twitter.

I've always had an interest in video games ranging from real-time strategies to first-person shooters. But what's better than playing them -- than to make them! Game development for me is like itching that creative urge, it takes all forms of disciplines from art, music, programming, and storytelling. It gives me an appreciation for games as a work of art.

- Homelab

I run a homelab at my house which consists of a pfSense router, a 16-port edgeswitch, and a unifi access point for my home network. I have a single virtualization Environment server running Proxmox. This is how I get my tinkering fix for all computer and network related needs. This usually involves breaking system services and network connections pretty often.

My first exposure into creating my own homelab was running my own Raspberry Pi cloud storage server in my college aparment. What turned out to be small project led me to discover the amazing world of GNU/Linux, Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), and configuring networks of routers and switches. I am now a proud owner of a homelab!
