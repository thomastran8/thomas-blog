## Introduction

Hello there, allow me to introduce myself!

I am a System Administrator and a Hobby Game Developer.

My first exposure into system administration was running my own Raspberry Pi cloud storage server in my college aparment. What turned out to be small project ended up being a rabbit hole of discovering the amazing world of GNU/Linux, Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), and configuring routers and switches. I am now a proud owner of a homelab!

As for game development, I've always had an interest in video games ranging from real-time strategies to first-person shooters. But what's better than playing them -- than to make them! Game development for me is like itching that creative urge, it takes all forms of disciplines from art, music, programming, and storytelling. It gives me appreciation for games as a work of art and to see others enjoy my games as well!

## Work Experience

- IT Admin, Skydio

I currently work at Skydio as an IT Admin! I joined in 2018 after I graducated UC Davis. Skydio is a startup company that manufactures drones that specializes in artificial intelligence.

## Hobbies

- Homelab

I run a homelab at my house which consists of a pfSense router, a 16-port edgeswitch, and a unifi access point for my home network. I have a single virtualization Environment server running Proxmox. This is how I get my tinkering fix for all computer and network related needs. This usually involves breaking system services and network connections pretty often.

- Game Development

I do indie game development. At the moment I have an interest in 3D game development. Some engines I worked with so far is the Unity Game Engine and the Unreal Game Engine. I aim to release a small personal game every year.
