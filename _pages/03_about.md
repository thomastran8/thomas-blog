## Introduction

I am a Devops Engineer and a Game Developer.

My first exposure into devops was running my own Raspberry Pi cloud storage server in my college aparment. What turned out to be small project led me to discover the amazing world of GNU/Linux, Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), and configuring networks of routers and switches. I am now a proud owner of a homelab!

As for game development, I've always had an interest in video games ranging from real-time strategies to first-person shooters. But what's better than playing them -- than to make them! Game development for me is like itching that creative urge, it takes all forms of disciplines from art, music, programming, and storytelling. It gives me an appreciation for games as a work of art.

I run a homelab at my house which consists of a pfSense router, a 16-port edgeswitch, and a unifi access point for my home network. I have a single virtualization Environment server running Proxmox. This is how I get my tinkering fix for all computer and network related needs. This usually involves breaking system services and network connections pretty often.

I do indie game development. At the moment I have an interest in 3D game development. Some engines I worked with so far is the Unity Game Engine and the Godot Game Engine. I post regular game development project updates on my Twitter.
