Hi, I'm a computer programmer and I recently graduated from UC Davis in 2018 with a Bachelor's degree in computer science. During my time at UC Davis I have taken roles as Activities Assistant and Mentor at in the UC Davis Game Development and Arts Club.

## Hobbies:
- Game development
    - I love making game in Unity. I was introduced to the Unity Game Engine when I joined the Game Development and Arts Club at Davis.
- Linux tinkering
    - I enjoy using the terminal and playing around the commands. My distro of choice is Arch Linux.
- Jogging
    - I go for mile jogs every other day to the park. It's a great way to exercise!
- Cruising
    - Occasionally I take my Penny nickel board for a spin. It's fun to zip around the city.

## Goals:
Gain experience as a software engineer.
